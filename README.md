#  Welcome to the Philippines PIRE Project GitHub Repository! 

The Philippines PIRE Project is a multi-year collaboration between Filipino and American scientists and universities funded by the National Science Foundation to support international research and education.  The project offers research experience and training to students and conducts research to assess the anthropogenic impact on genetic diversity of fish populations over more than 100 years of overfishing and habitat degradation in the Philippines.

In this repository, you can learn about the research carried out by the project staff and REU students, and find resources provided in our genomics workshop every summer in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, Philippines.
