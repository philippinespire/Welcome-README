#  Welcome to the Albatross Re-Collection Project! 

The Albatross Re-Collection Project is a multi-year collaboration between Filipino and American scientists and universities funded by the National Science Foundation. 

Over a century ago, the [USS Albatross](https://ocean.si.edu/human-connections/exploration/deep-sea-research-100-years-ago-us-fisheries-steamer-albatross) collected fishes from the Philippines, now stored at the Smithsonian Institution. Surprisingly, the samples were never fixed in formalin, which would have altered the DNA. The collection therefore provide an incredibly archive of century-old fish genomes and rare insights into how fish have evolved in response to fishing, habitat loss, and other challenges. The Albatross Re-Collection Project is now comparing historical and modern fish genomes and phenotypes to test for evolution and to understand its consequences and implications. The research findings can help understand adaptation across many species facing similar challenges. The project also supports paid research internships for students with limited access to careers in science, and hosts workshops to foster international exchange with the Philippines.

In this repository, you can learn about the research carried out by the project staff and REU students, find links to our products and publications, and find resources provided in our summer genomics workshops.

## Participants
Partners on the U.S. side of the collaboration include the [University of California Santa Cruz](https://globalchange.sites.ucsc.edu/), [Texas A&M University â€“ Corpus Christi](https://www.tamucc.edu/science/research/genomics/), [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/directory/kent-carpenter), and the [Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/vertebrate-zoology/fishes). On the Philippines side, scientists at [Silliman University](http://su.edu.ph/), the [National Fisheries Research & Development Institute](http://www.nfrdi.da.gov.ph/), the [University of the Philippines](https://msi.upd.edu.ph/faculty/rene-abesamis/), and [Mindanao State University](http://www.msumain.edu.ph/) in the Philippines to advance our understanding of genetic and species transformations in the epicenter of marine biodiversity. The project is currently led by Malin Pinsky, Chris Bird, Brendan Reid, Nadia Palomar-Abesamis, and Kent Carpenter.
